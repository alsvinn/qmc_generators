# qmc_generators
This is an API adaptation of the generators found in http://people.sc.fsu.edu/~jburkardt/cpp_src/halton/halton.html by John Halton. 

No alteration has been done to the algorithms in this repository, this is simply an adaptation of the API for these generators to be used with the [Alsvinn simulator](https://github.com/alsvinn/alsvinn).
